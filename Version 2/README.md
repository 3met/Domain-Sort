# Domain-Sort
#### By Emet Behrendt

## Description
Filters domain names from long lists. Contains options to filter one or two word domains as well as to filter domains by specific lengths. Also filters out your choice of top level domains.

_Note: I **highly** recommended you use version 2 (this version) over version 1_

## Instructions
### For Python Version
Paste a list of domains into the "input-domains.txt" file. Each line should contain one domain.

Create a list of all TLDs or words/symbols you want to skip over in the filtering process. Put this list into "input-skiplist.txt" file. Each line should contain a different item. This step is optional.

Run sort_domain.py and follow instructions on screen.

### For Compiled Version

Create a list of all TLDs or words/symbols you want to skip over in the filtering process. Put this list into "input-skiplist.txt" file. Each line should contain a different item. This step is optional.
